## Obstacle Avoidance Exercise (9/17/20)
### Goals:
- Learn some basics of opencv and working with image data in python
- Implement a simple Edge-Based Obstacle Avoidance technique described in the tutorial linked below \

** This depends on the ground being a single color, not a super great technique, but good intro **
### Setup
- Install Python 3 
- pip install opencv-python

### Directions:
1. Read the tutorial below and at each step, figure out how to convert the description of each image transform to python code
    - Follow the first section on the Edge-Based technique
    - Then go to the last section on the site and implement the code to output which direction the robot should move to avoid obstacles
2. Test your code on the provided images and check that it works as expected
3. Think about the drawbacks of using this method. How could you improve it?
